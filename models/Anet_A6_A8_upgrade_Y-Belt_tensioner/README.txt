# Summary

UPDATE 31-12-2016: Some people had problems with the Frame_L and Frame_R so I have update these files. they are a little bit stronger now. If you have problems with the size, you can contact me and i will make a smaller version for it :D

I have made this upgrade for my Anet Anet A6 and A8 3D printers to get the X-Belt to make it easy tighten it up.

Two friends of my asked me to make one and I wanted to make one myself so that's why I created this tensioner.

You will need to use this tensioner all parts 1 time(Frame_L and Frame_R are the same!). Also, you will need in total 5 M3 screws and bolts(1x ~30mm and 4x ~10mm).

A great youtuber maked a video about this model:
